Hey, thanks for stopping by! :wave:

I’m a ECE Master student at University of Toronto, currently working with [Prof. Piero Triverio](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/triverio-p/) in [Modelics Lab](http://www.modelics.org). I’m grateful to be supported by the Edward S Rogers Sr Graduate Scholarship.

Before that, I completed my undergraduate (ECE, advised by [Prof. Qiang Ren](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/renqiang/zh_CN/index.htm)) degrees at [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn) in 2020, with bachelor’s thesis in Computational Electromagentics.

I also spend a summer at [UCLA Bioengineering](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu) as a visiting student at [Prof. Jun Chen](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/jun-chen/) Group for Bioelectronics Research.

<font size=5><strong>Research Interests</strong></font>

My research goal is to model and simulate physical systems at different scales by integrating numerical methods (boundary element method, finite difference method) and machine learning techniques, with particular interests in solving Maxwell’s equation in complex geometries.
